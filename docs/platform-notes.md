# Platform Notes

Per-platform behavior, backend selection, and known issues. See [Integration Strategies](compose/integration-strategies.md) for how Filament's GPU output reaches the Compose canvas on each target.

## Backend selection

Filament KMP follows Filament's default backend — you typically don't need to override it.

| Platform | Default backend | Override |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Android | OpenGL ES 3.x (Vulkan on newer devices) | `Engine.Backend.VULKAN` |
| iOS / macOS (Kotlin/Native) | Metal | — (Metal only) |
| Desktop macOS (JVM) | Metal | `Engine.Backend.OPENGL` |
| Windows | Vulkan | `Engine.Backend.OPENGL` |
| Linux | Vulkan | `Engine.Backend.OPENGL` |
| Web | WebGL 2.0 | — (WebGL only) |

Override via `rememberFilamentEngine(backend = Engine.Backend.OPENGL)` or `Engine.create(Engine.Backend.OPENGL)`.

> [!TIP]
> If you see GPU crashes or rendering artifacts on a specific machine, **try the OpenGL backend** first — driver-level Vulkan bugs are far more common than OpenGL ones on consumer hardware.

## Android

- Uses the official `com.google.android.filament` Maven library — same code path Google uses internally.
- `SurfaceView` is used for rendering; Compose overlays on top are limited (see [Integration Strategies](compose/integration-strategies.md)). For full overlay support, render into a `TextureView` (not currently exposed by `filament-compose`).
- Minimum `compileSdk`: **34**. Minimum `minSdk`: **24**.

### Screen rotation and configuration changes

By default Android destroys and recreates the `Activity` on rotation, which tears down the Compose composition and reloads all Filament assets. This behavior predates Compose — it existed to reload XML layouts and resource qualifiers (`layout-land/`, `values-night/`) automatically.

In a pure Compose app none of that applies: layouts are code, theming reacts to system broadcasts, and Filament's `SurfaceView` already handles the viewport update via `surfaceChanged`. To keep the composition alive across rotation, add `android:configChanges` to your `<activity>` in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|smallestScreenSize|uiMode|keyboard|keyboardHidden|navigation"
    ...>
```

This is standard practice for graphics, video, and game apps on Android. The `SurfaceView` still receives `surfaceChanged` on resize, so the viewport and aspect ratio update correctly without any extra code.

## iOS / macOS (Kotlin/Native)

- Renders via `CAMetalLayer` embedded in a `UIKitView`.
- Use static frameworks (`isStatic = true`) — keeps the Filament symbols inside your app binary and avoids dynamic-library loader issues.
- macOS via JVM (Compose Desktop) and macOS via Kotlin/Native are **different code paths**. The Kotlin/Native path uses the C wrapper; the JVM path uses the JNI bindings.

## JVM / Desktop

### Pixel readback overhead

The Desktop integration renders to an offscreen `RenderTarget` and copies pixels back to the CPU each frame for Skia compositing. Expect:

- **1–2 frames of latency** vs. a native swap-chain.
- **CPU overhead** scaling with window size (a 4K window copies ~33 MB/frame).
- A **150 ms resize debounce** before reallocating textures — drag-resizing feels slightly stuttery, but final layout is clean.

This is unavoidable with Compose Desktop today: there is no public API to embed a native rendering surface inside a Skia canvas.

### Native library loading

The JNI runtime JAR (`io.github.erkko68.filament-jni:filament:...`) bundles platform-specific shared libraries (`.dll`, `.dylib`, `.so`) as JAR resources and extracts them to a temp directory on first use. No system installation of Filament is needed.

## Web / WASM

> [!WARNING]
> The web target is **experimental** and not feature-complete.

### Filament.js and WASM bundle

`filament.js` and `filament.wasm` must be placed in your app's `src/jsMain/resources/` directory so webpack serves them alongside your compiled JS. They are not propagated automatically from the library because Kotlin/JS klib resources are not picked up by webpack in downstream Maven consumers.

Download the files matching your `filaVersion` using the helper script in the repo:

```bash
python3 scripts/download_filament_prebuilts.py <version> web
# outputs prebuilts/web/filament.js and prebuilts/web/filament.wasm
```

Then copy them into your `src/jsMain/resources/`.

### Current limitations

- `MaterialProvider.createMaterialInstance()` and `getMaterial()` return `null` — the default ubershader path doesn't work. Supply your own precompiled materials.
- `KTX1Loader`, `HDRLoader`, `TextureLoader` factories return `null` on JS. Use simpler image formats and the standard `Texture.Builder`.
- `Manipulator` builder methods return `null`. Use `filament-compose`'s `rememberOrbitCameraState` (pure Kotlin implementation) instead.

Suitable for simple scenes with custom materials. Not yet suitable for full glTF pipelines or image-based lighting via KTX.

### Bundle size

The Filament.js + WASM blob adds **~2 MB compressed** to your web bundle. Lazy-load the `FilamentView`-containing screen if startup time matters.

## Threading model

All Filament objects are **bound to the thread that created the Engine**. The Compose DSL ensures all calls happen on the UI thread automatically. If you use the raw API:

- Create the `Engine` on the UI thread.
- Call all `engine.*` methods from the UI thread.
- Long-running asset preparation (decoding images, parsing glTF) can happen on a background thread; only the final GPU upload (`ResourceLoader`, `Texture.setImage`) must be on the engine thread.
